# AIOS — Artificial Intelligence Operating System

AIOS is an **epistemic operating system for AI reasoning**.  
It is designed to ingest unstructured data, extract claims, track provenance, detect contradictions, and manage multiple “worlds” of belief without collapsing uncertainty into premature truth.

AIOS is not a chatbot framework.  
It is infrastructure for **thinking systems**.

## Core Principles

- **Claims are not facts**  
  All extracted claims begin as *unverified* and reside in a liminal epistemic state until promoted.

- **Truth is procedural**  
  Truth emerges through evidence, contradiction analysis, and world separation — not assertion.

## What AIOS Is For

- Long-term AI memory
- Contradiction-aware reasoning
- Multi-world simulations
- Knowledge curation pipelines
- Epistemic hygiene in AI systems

---

## What AIOS Is Not

- A chatbot UI
- A knowledge graph toy
- A vector database wrapper
- A truth oracle

---

## Status

AIOS is under active development.
Expect rapid iteration, schema evolution, and experimental reasoning modules.

## License

Project licensing will be published as the system stabilizes.
